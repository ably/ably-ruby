    # The Connection class represents the connection associated with an Ably Realtime instance.
    # The Connection object exposes the lifecycle and parameters of the realtime connection.
    #
    # Connections will always be in one of the following states:
    #
    #   initialized:  0
    #   connecting:   1
    #   connected:    2
    #   disconnected: 3
    #   suspended:    4
    #   closing:      5
    #   closed:       6
    #   failed:       7

    # Note that the states are available as Enum-like constants:
    #
    #   Connection::STATE.Initialized
    #   Connection::STATE.Connecting
    #   Connection::STATE.Connected
    #   Connection::STATE.Disconnected
    #   Connection::STATE.Suspended
